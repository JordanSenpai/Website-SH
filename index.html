    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Jordan Koon and I have had the idea to make this game for quite some time.  Before RefactorU, I never had the skills to translate my dream to the screen, but now I am confident to say I have the tools to make it happen with what RefactorU has taught me. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> once said that The Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by his explorations as a young boy in the hillsides surrounding his childhood home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe,_Kyoto">Sonobe, Japan</a>. There he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. Like Miyamoto, when I was younger, my entire life revolved around wanting to adventure and slay villains. That is where my game idea came from. I hope you truly enjoy my game! Thank you for trying it! </p>
