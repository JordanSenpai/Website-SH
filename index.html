    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Jordan Koon and I have had the idea to make this game for quite some time but never had the skills to quite translate it to the screen but now I am confident to say I now have the tools to make it happen with what RefactorU has taught me. Shigeru Miyamoto once said that The Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by his explorations as a young boy in the hillsides surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. Like Miyamoto, when I was younger my entire life was revolved around wanting to adventure and slay villains and that is where my game idea came from. I hope you trully enjoy my game! Thank you for trying it! </p>
